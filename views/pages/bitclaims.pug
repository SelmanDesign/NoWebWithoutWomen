      .threehold#bitdip
        p.projwords The founders of BitClaims wanted to do something big: use blockchain technology to build price transparency within the primary care market. The team had a great idea, but no product. I was one of two designers asked to make this a reality. Our mission was to build:
      .threefold
        .values
          h3.projtitle Price Transparency
          p.projwords The product lets users explore primary care services, see pricing, and purchase plans.
        .values
          h3.projtitle Power in Numbers
          p.projwords BitClaims allows patients to form a pool, bundling care together to receive discounts.
        .values 
          h3.projtitle Patient Choice
          p.projwords BitClaims surfaces the features of a plan, facility information and doctor profiles.

            p.projwords Thus began a process of uncovering initial interaction. From there we began to sketch low fidelity wireframes. Through this process we refined the search and price discovery user flow. We developed a number of key features during this process.

          h3.projtitle Atomic Components
          p.projwords Building out a library of components, we created an extensible system to meet the product needs. Components included doctor profiles, service pages and facility pages. Adding to this user flow, we began developing an on boarding process and a payment user flow. Of particular interest was adding a feature to allow payment in crypto. This was of particular interest to those providing the initial funding of the project.
