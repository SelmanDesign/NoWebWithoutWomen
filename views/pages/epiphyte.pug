            h3.projtitle Taking Form
            p.projwords From the start, I was interested in a creating a bot that could be placed as an observation station, monitoring a lichen or moss sample in real time. I coded the tradebot in python, using Open CV libraries for much of the computer vision work and Intrino for my trade API. While the code is quite rudimentary, it represents a proof of concept. I hope to collaborate with developers in the future to create a more robust code base.
