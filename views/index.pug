              div#landing-para When digital devices connect to disseminate, discover and fetch computational algorithms, an Internet of Rules (IoR) is created. This enables devices to rapidly discover rules that are in effect for given contexts, applicable to specific perameters, and  operable for validation against documentation.

                div.para-content Until now, there has been no generic method, protocol or standard to disseminate, discover, fetch and triage computational algorithms over the Internet, equivalent to the scale and ubiquity which has long been available for text, image and audio data. An 'algorithm' is a type of functional data f( ) that, when combined with input data x, generates output data f(x). An Internet of Rules transmits algorithms on-demand with assurance, integrity,  reliability, confidentiality, auditability, persistence, efficiency and ubiquity for our emergent distributed, dynamic, data-driven world.

                  div.para-content Unlike procedural methods that operate through step-by-step commands, Interlibr employs declarative methods that operate through naïve data filtering from ordered lists. This is suited to extremely fast parallel processing.  Algorithms are expressed as simple control-tables (decision-tables, dataframes, data grids, tuples) that implement a GIVEN-WHEN-THEN pattern of logic. Employing large stores of passive data, declarative methods are ideally suited to decentralized contexts.

Authors of rules may use XalgoRM (or equivalent) to publish their rule.xalgo declarative data, and any supporting table.xalgo reference data to Interlibr. Interlibr uses the incoming is.xalgo metadata:data ("key:value pairs") to filter rules “in effect” for a GIVEN context (identities & date/time); and separates rules that are “applicable” WHEN the particular facts appear. It tests the filtered results, THEN returns an ought.xalgo response.
